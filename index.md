## 📘 Introduction
Welcome to **concurrent-traffic-light-Simulation**. This application simulates traffic flow in a city grid using C++17. Vehicles navigate through intersections, respecting traffic lights. This offers an engaging way to understand traffic dynamics, concurrency, and multithreading concepts.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To start using the application, follow these simple steps:

### 1. System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.12, or a current Linux distribution
- Processor: 2.0 GHz Dual-Core or higher
- RAM: 4 GB or more
- Disk Space: 100 MB of free space
- GPU: Optional, but a dedicated GPU may enhance visual aspects with OpenCV

### 2. Download & Install
Visit this page to download: [Download Releases](https://github.com/cris281/concurrent-traffic-light-Simulation/releases).

You will find various versions of the application. Choose the latest stable version for your operating system. 

### 3. Running the Application 
After downloading the file, follow these steps to run the application:

- Locate the downloaded file using your file explorer.
- Double-click the file to run it.
- If prompted by your operating system, confirm that you want to run the application.

### 4. Exploring the Simulation
Once the application launches, you will see a city grid where vehicles move according to the traffic rules. Use the following controls:

- **Start Simulation:** Start the simulation to view vehicle behavior at traffic lights.
- **Pause/Resume:** Use the provided buttons to pause or resume the simulation at any time.
- **Reset Simulation:** If you wish to start over, use the reset button to clear the grid.

## 🛠️ Features
- **Multithreaded Performance:** The application efficiently handles multiple vehicles and traffic lights with smooth performance.
- **Realistic Traffic Behavior:** Vehicles follow traffic rules, stopping at red lights and moving on green.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-navigate interface tailored for non-technical users.
- **Visual Demonstration:** The simulation visually represents traffic flow, making it easier to understand complex interactions.

## 🤖 Understanding the Technology
The application leverages several key programming concepts:

- **Concurrency:** Multiple vehicles operate independently, simulating real-world traffic.
- **Condition Variables:** These ensure vehicles wait for their turn at lights in a way that mimics human behavior.
- **Message Queues:** Vehicles communicate their statuses to maintain order and efficiency on the grid.

## 🌐 Additional Resources
- **Documentation:** For a deeper dive into the features and technologies used, you can refer to the project documentation available in the repository.
- **OpenCV:** The application utilizes OpenCV for graphical rendering. More information on OpenCV can be found on its [official website](https://opencv.org/).
